  Misc.
  -----------
Land of Sound

• Learn more about using Wikipedia for research •Jump to: navigation, search
The Land of Sound (???, Oto no Kuni?) is a geographical feature in the Naruto anime and manga series. It was likely named after the Otogakure, which Orochimaru founded, and both refer to what could be considered as one political entity.

The Land of Sound, along with Otogakure, is a relatively new country in the political scene, though the country itself existed long before Orochimaru took it over and renamed it. It conspired with the Land of Wind to launch a surprise attack and hopefully destroy the Land of Fire. Instead of using elemental jutsu, Sound ninja use sonic-based jutsu, often augmented by various devices.

In the anime, the country in which Orochimaru established his village is named the "Land of Rice Fields" or "Rice Field Country" (???, Ta no Kuni?). Orochimaru seems to have renamed it after his takeover.


Otogakure
Otogakure (?????, Otogakure no Sato?, literally "Village Hidden in Sound") was founded by Orochimaru as a part of the Land of Sound, and is run by him. Not much is known about it: what is certain is that it actually consists of a series of lairs, located both within the Sound country and away from it, which Orochimaru switches between every week. Other than that, and the fact that its ninja specialize in techniques involving manipulation of sound waves, as well as using a cursed seal to increase their power, little else is known about it. Although he is the leading ninja of Otogakure, Orochimaru isn't a Kage, despite his equivalent power level. The reason for this is because the five Kages of the five great Hidden Villages don't acknowledge Otogakure, and certainly would not acknowledge a criminal like Orochimaru.

With Orochimaru's defeat at the hands of Sasuke Uchiha, the various bases formerly under Orochimaru's control have begun to rebel and their inhabitants are trying to escape to freedom.



Kimimaro Kaguya

Age: 152 (deceased)

Seiyu: Toshiyuki Morikawa

Kimimaro Kaguya (??????, Kaguya Kimimaro?) is the sole survivor of the Kaguya clan (?????, Kaguya Ichizoku?), which was wiped out when they attacked Kirigakure for the thrill of battle. Kimimaro was referred to by Orochimaru as the most powerful member of the clan, causing him to be locked away in a cage for most of his life, only released occasionally when needed to fight. After the deaths of his family he was found by Orochimaru, and developed a strong devotion towards him bordering on religious zealotry, as he saw Orochimaru as the only person who cared for and inspired him. Despite his abilities and heritage, Kimimaro was not truly violent because he never really knew the outside world. Thus, the only reason he fought was because his clan needed him to do so, and being needed by someone was the one thing he truly desired. These views change upon meeting Orochimaru, where his desires change to serving him and ensuring the continuation of his master's dreams and ambitions. This lack of interest in killing allowed him to form a friendship with Jugo at one point, and he acted as the only person capable of stopping Jugo's rampages.

Kimimaro's Shikotsumyaku ability allows him to control and grow his own bones at will, allowing him to form weapons for close-range combat. Since he can regenerate and make new bones, he has an endless supply of bones he can use against his opponent. When in his cursed seal level 2 form, his appearance becomes similar to that of a dinosaur, with dark gray skin, six large bone spines on the back of his chest, and a long bone-spiked tail. While he is normally able to evade or block physical attacks with little effort, the level 2 form slows him down and allows him to be struck more easily. He possesses a great deal of control over his cursed seal, as he is able to control its spread throughout his body without fully activating it. Kimimaro's only weakness is a terminal illness that he constantly suffers from. The sickness seems to have been recently developed, as he was once a prime candidate for Orochimaru's next host body. After being left bedridden and on life support, Kimimaro sets out to retrieve Orochimaru's new host: Sasuke Uchiha. He is forced into battle with Rock Lee and Gaara during the process where, although he is almost able to kill them both, he succumbs to his illness and dies.






 Final Notes and Tips:
 =======================

         Some tips you should remember when using kimimaro:

         1. You can turn into Curse Seal transformation in battle. See commands list for more                    details.

         2. He do not use kunais, instead of use sound Teshi Sendan (normal player).

         3. Do not forget use your chakra power to performer hyper attacks.

         4. "go away! special" is unguardable, he can get down your opponent in any circustances.
         
         5. When is Chakra On! you can shoot bullets simultaneous.


 Extra Info:
 -------------------
         a-. The MAX HYPER ATTACK is a copy from the author "Xavier - kyuubi__naruto - 
             Ultimatedude" for more compatibility and common characters.

         b-. Some specials move has been coded using KOF characters like chakra ON, Sound
             effects, helpers.etc.

         c-. Some states explain how it works, see the files for more information.


         d-. Change the classic "QCF QCF_x" commands to a+b buttons in hyper attacks to 
             avoid mixing commands with special moves "QCF_x". easy to fight and beat!!

    
 BUGS:
 -------------------
 I`d had fixing bugs known, the most were in common-states (5000-5999), some other depends the-
 changeanim2 in grab states in each players.

         a-. In some cases when the opponent use the changeanim2 controller, this code values 
             must be exist (animations in AIR), see your player cns when MUGEN display invalid
             states.

         b-. BUGS when the opponent use the changeanim2 controller.
	     in order to respect the required sprites, always will use the standard groups
	     (5000-5072), These sprites are necessary for your character to appear correctly
 	     when   thrown. sorry, I could`nt fix that.
