      Tayuya is a sample character that works with M.U.G.E.N.
      This version is meant for use with M.U.G.E.N version 2002.04.14.

      To use her, unzip his files into chars/tayuya. Then open up
      data/select.def with a text editor and add the following
      line to the [Characters] group:

      tayuya

      It's that easy to get started!

      You may freely modify and/or distribute tayuya and his work files.
      All Commands are standard as kfm files. This player has been modified 
      from its original version.

    Basic Controls
    --------------
      DF means diagonally down-forwards, UB diagonally up-back,
      etc. If you see ab it means press button A and button B
      simultaneously. x/y means hit either x or y, and so on.

      Use the direction keys to move Tayuya. Press down to crouch,
      and up to jump. While in the air, you can press up again to
      air-jump. Hold the direction facing away from the opponent
      to guard. KFM can guard attacks while jumping.

      When falling in the air, hit buttons X and Y at the same
      time to recover. Hold a directional key when recovering to
      move a little bit in that direction. If you are near the
      ground when you hit xy, you will do a ground-based recovery
      instead.

      Tayuya has a taunt. To do it, press the start button.

Age: 14 (deceased) 
Seiyu: Akeno Watanabe 
Voice actor: Kari Wahlgren 


Tayuya is the kunoichi of the Sound Four and the only member to actually use sound as a weapon; she uses a flute in battle. Because this is her only weapon, she avoids close combat at all costs. To help her with this, she can summon three powerful demons known as the Doki (Doki literally "Angry Demons") that she controls by playing different tunes on her flute. In addition to being very fast for their size, the Doki can open their mouths to release a many-mouthed, snake-like creature. These snakes, being made of energy and therefore impossible to hit, absorb the energy of others on contact, thus weakening them. If the demons aren't enough to keep opponents at bay, Tayuya can use her flute to trap an opponent in a genjutsu. Once affected, the target feels as if they are tied with numerous wires, restricting their movement. Soon after, their flesh will begin to melt away from their bones, causing great pain and horror.

When in level 2 cursed seal form, Tayuya's hair grows longer, her skin turns dark brown, and she grows five bone-like horns on her head. She is relatively foul-mouthed (a trait for which Jirobo berates her) and ill tempered. Tayuya is very intelligent and can think of strategies and battle tactics almost on par with Shikamaru Nara. Despite this she does not think much of Shikamaru as a leader, believing that he is a fool for sacrificing his friends at each turn. She is almost able to defeat Shikamaru, but he is saved by Temari who levels the surrounding forest and crushes Tayuya under debris.





 Final Notes and Tips:
 =======================

         Some tips you should remember when using tayuya:

         1. All her basic moves are the same as KFM. (deprecated, change to DS moves)

         2. You can turn into Curse Seal transformation in battle. See commands list for more                    details.

         3. The Strengh of tayuya are the Demons, so performer kuchiyose no jutsu to summon them and             you beat your enemy very easy. See commands list for more details.

         4. If you hit success with DS Special, there´s no need to perform "kuchiyose no jutsu" to control the demons (see Makyou no Ran "Doki" commands).

         5. She do not use kunais, instead of use sound projectiles.

         6. The Curse Seal Form, take more damage to their enemies and some speed attack.

         7. mateki:mugen onsa freeze the opponent a few seconds to perform a combo.

         8. Do not forget use your chakra power to performer hyper attacks.

         9. PeudoGhosts decrease the power of the opponents by a amount of -200 for each hit.

         10. the dokis (demons) are invencibles from most known hits and projectiles. try it out!


 Extra Info:
 -------------------
         a-. The MAX HYPER ATTACK is a copy from the author "Xavier - kyuubi__naruto - 
             Ultimatedude" for more compatibility and common characters.

         b-. Some specials move has been coded using KOF characters like chakra ON, Sound
             effects, helpers.etc.

         c-. Some states explain how it works, see the files for more information.


         d-. Change the classic "QCF QCF_x" commands to a+b buttons in hyper attacks to 
             avoid mixing commands with special moves "QCF_x". easy to fight and beat!!

 
         e-. If you having problems with AI activation code, open tayuya.def and put the-
	     alternative CNS and CMD to normal AI (common known as NO-AI).	     


         f-. The KeyCtrl Helper method AI is not working yet (disabled), but in any 
             circunstances I put the states for future updates.
             
         g-. Tayuya has been updated using "Batofara"´char as a reference.
              
         h-. Tayuya now move as a DS player.
         
         j-. Hyper attacks has been change at all see list command above (their are mark as *update and *new.)
         
         k-. misaligments and hitsparks almost fixing (60%) all hitdef updated too.
         
 BUGS:
 -------------------
 I`d had fixing bugs known, the most were in common-states (5000-5999), some other depends the-
 changeanim2 in grab states in each players.

         a-. In some cases when the opponent use the changeanim2 controller, this code values 
             must be exist (animations in AIR), see your player cns when MUGEN display invalid
             states.

         b-. BUGS when the opponent use the changeanim2 controller.
	     in order to respect the required sprites, always will use the standard groups
	      (5000-5072), These sprites are necessary for your character to appear correctly when                thrown.  sorry, I could`nt fix that.

         c-. Sometimes the AI activation code turn ON even when you are select the character,
             seems like a "watch mode"; if this happen, removal the AI-cns and AI-cmd files from
             DEF file. (see DEF file for extra information).	

         d-. Some bug fixes listed below
             Varsets bug in chakra power now fix
             Jump animation (44-49) has been change to (64-69) to avoid mixing animation
             require.

         e-. Varsets 12,13,14 are deprecated in this version.


Updates Section (April 2008) :
 -------------------
         Since last Beta release 2.0 this character has new changes:

         1. Fix bug in statedef 5050 (a invalid state) from CS.

         2. Now she can throw Kunais in Wall-Stand State Diag Down (see command list).
         
         3. Fix a lot of PCX images that automatically mess up the animations.
            (links images that automatically change each time I saved the SFF file)
            I don`t get it yet what it do (link-images).
         
         4. State 20-21 with correct axis now.
         
         5. Now she cancel moves when chakra is ON in basic moves (Experimental).
