; (notice the elem=6 parameter). If you don't see what I mean, try commenting

;Crouching light punch
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Description: Simple crouching attack. The HitDef's guardflag parameter
;     is set to "L", meaning that the move can only be guarded low
;     (crouching), and not by standing or jumping opponents.
;     Like for all light attacks, it's a good idea to keep the slidetime
;     and hittime parameters at a smaller number, so the opponent isn't
;     stunned for too long. For all crouching attacks you have to
;     remember to set the attr parameter to indicate that it is crouching
;     attack. In this case, "C, NA" stands for "crouching, normal attack".
;     The HitDef's priority is set at 3, instead of the default of 4,
;     so this attack has a lower priority than most others, meaning
;     KFM will get hit instead of trading hits with his opponent if
;     their attack collision boxes (Clsn1) intersect each other's Clsn2
;     boxes at the same time.

;Crouching strong punch
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Description: This is a 2-hit move. It is done by having two HitDefs
;     triggered, one for each frame of animation that hits.
;     Notice how the first hit cannot be guarded by an opponent in the
;     air, because of the "M" in the guardflag, meaning it can only
;     be guarded "middle". The second hit has an "MA" guardflag, so
;     it can be guarded both on the ground and in the air.
; CNS レベル: 易
; 詳細: これは殴打が二発ある攻撃です。
; 殴打できるアニメーションの枚は一々HitDefを登録しています。
; 一発目の攻撃のHitDefにはguardflagが「M」（middle＝中段ガード）
; にセットされているので、相手は空中でガードできません。二発目
; の攻撃のguardflagは「MA」（middle+air＝中段＋空中ガード）で、
; 地上、空中でもガードすることができます。

;Kung Fu Throw - Attempt
; CNS difficulty: medium-advanced
; Description: Throws are not difficult to make, although then can be
;     tedious at times. Throw attempt states have a HitDef of a
;     special format. The key parameters in a throw are p1stateno
;     and p2stateno. If the HitDef successfully connects, then
;     the attacker will change to the state number specified by
;     p1stateno, and the opponent will be change to the state
;     number assigned to p2stateno. The special thing about p2stateno
;     is that the opponent will be temporarily brought into the
;     attacker's state file. In this case, no matter who the
;     opponent is, he will be taken to state 820 of this file (kfm.cns)
;     and remain here until the end of the throw (look at his debug
;     information when he is being thrown; the text changes to yellow
;     to mean that he is in another player's state file).

;Kung Fu Throw - Throwing the opponent
; Description: In this state, KFM throws the opponent by binding him to
;     various offsets based on his current frame of animation. For
;     example, [State 810, Bind 1] binds the opponent to an offset of
;     28 pixels in front of KFM. That puts him around where KFM's hand
;     is at. Is is important to keep the opponent bound using a
;     TargetBind controller at all times, until you let him go. This
;     is especially important if your player has a Clsn2 box that
;     allows him to get hit while throwing someone. Each time a player
;     gets hit, all his bound targets will be set to a fall state. If
;     the opponent is not bound, then he may get stuck in his thrown
;     state when his attacker is knocked out of the throw halfway.
; Notes: There is a TargetLifeAdd controller to decrease the opponent's
;     life, and a TargetState controller to change his state to a
;     falling state when KFM lets go of him.

;     whereas ChangeAnim always changes the player to an action in his

;   when the opponent is farther away. The main differences between
;   the near and far versions of the HitDefs is that the near version
;   has a "fall" parameter set to 1, causing the opponent to be knocked
;   down. Other minor differences are the damage, and the velocity to
;   give the opponent.
;   The line "attr = S, SA" line means this is a Standing, Special Attack.
;   It is important you have the attr parameter set correctly for all

; Light Kung Fu Upper
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Description: This is a simple special attack that can hit twice. Notice
;     the use of the Width controller to keep opponents from getting too
;     close to KFM during his uppercut (press Ctrl-C, and look at the
;     yellow bar at KFM's feet during the move).
;     The second HitDef has some interesting parameters. fall.recovertime
;     is used to prevent the opponent (p2) from recovering immediately
;     after being hit (eg. press x+y with KFM to recover). This gives the
;     attacking KFM a chance to follow up with an extra attack, such as
;     a Kung Fu Knee. The yaccel parameter, set at 0.4, makes p2 fall at a
;     greater value of acceleration than the default, which is 0.35.
