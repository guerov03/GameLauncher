; (notice the elem=6 parameter). If you don't see what I mean, try commenting

;Crouching light punch
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Description: Simple crouching attack. The HitDef's guardflag parameter
;     is set to "L", meaning that the move can only be guarded low
;     (crouching), and not by standing or jumping opponents.
;     Like for all light attacks, it's a good idea to keep the slidetime
;     and hittime parameters at a smaller number, so the opponent isn't
;     stunned for too long. For all crouching attacks you have to
;     remember to set the attr parameter to indicate that it is crouching
;     attack. In this case, "C, NA" stands for "crouching, normal attack".
;     The HitDef's priority is set at 3, instead of the default of 4,
;     so this attack has a lower priority than most others, meaning
;     KFM will get hit instead of trading hits with his opponent if
;     their attack collision boxes (Clsn1) intersect each other's Clsn2
;     boxes at the same time.

;Crouching strong punch
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Description: This is a 2-hit move. It is done by having two HitDefs
;     triggered, one for each frame of animation that hits.
;     Notice how the first hit cannot be guarded by an opponent in the
;     air, because of the "M" in the guardflag, meaning it can only
;     be guarded "middle". The second hit has an "MA" guardflag, so
;     it can be guarded both on the ground and in the air.

; 地上、空中でもガードすることができます。
