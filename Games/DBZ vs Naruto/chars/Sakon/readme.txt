Land of Sound

• Learn more about using Wikipedia for research •Jump to: navigation, search
The Land of Sound (???, Oto no Kuni?) is a geographical feature in the Naruto anime and manga series. It was likely named after the Otogakure, which Orochimaru founded, and both refer to what could be considered as one political entity.

The Land of Sound, along with Otogakure, is a relatively new country in the political scene, though the country itself existed long before Orochimaru took it over and renamed it. It conspired with the Land of Wind to launch a surprise attack and hopefully destroy the Land of Fire. Instead of using elemental jutsu, Sound ninja use sonic-based jutsu, often augmented by various devices.

In the anime, the country in which Orochimaru established his village is named the "Land of Rice Fields" or "Rice Field Country" (???, Ta no Kuni?). Orochimaru seems to have renamed it after his takeover.


Otogakure
Otogakure (?????, Otogakure no Sato?, literally "Village Hidden in Sound") was founded by Orochimaru as a part of the Land of Sound, and is run by him. Not much is known about it: what is certain is that it actually consists of a series of lairs, located both within the Sound country and away from it, which Orochimaru switches between every week. Other than that, and the fact that its ninja specialize in techniques involving manipulation of sound waves, as well as using a cursed seal to increase their power, little else is known about it. Although he is the leading ninja of Otogakure, Orochimaru isn't a Kage, despite his equivalent power level. The reason for this is because the five Kages of the five great Hidden Villages don't acknowledge Otogakure, and certainly would not acknowledge a criminal like Orochimaru.

With Orochimaru's defeat at the hands of Sasuke Uchiha, the various bases formerly under Orochimaru's control have begun to rebel and their inhabitants are trying to escape to freedom.


Sound Four
The Sound Four (????????, Otogakure no Shinobi Yonin Shu?, literally Hidden Sound Shinobi Four People) are Orochimaru's elite bodyguards. Each has been given a cursed seal by Orochimaru. The Sound Four were forced to accept Kimimaro Kaguya into their ranks for a short time, as he was stronger than all of their combined strength. All of them repeatedly refer to their opponents as "trash". As a group, the Sound Four are able to create a number of different barriers; Four Violet Flames Battle Encampment (????, Shishienjin?, English "Four Flames Formation"), for instance, allows them to create a box-like barrier around an that causes anything that touches it to burst into flames. To prevent themselves from being attacked and thus bringing down the barrier, the Sound Four create the same barrier around themselves.


Sakon and Ukon

Age: 142 (deceased) 
Seiyu: Shunsuke Sakuya 
Voice Actor Brian Beacock 
Sakon and the older Ukon are twin brothers who share positions in the Sound Four. To help distinguish between the two. Sakon wears beads around his neck and Ukon has a somewhat deeper voice. With their Kekkei Genkai ability, Sakon and Ukon are able to merge with the bodies of others. Ukon generally uses this ability to remain within Sakon's body where he sleeps, his head protruding from the back of Sakon's neck. Because Ukon spends so much time within his brother's body, he is not used to moving about on his own and tires easily when separated, forcing him to return to Sakon to regain his energy after a short time. Despite this, Ukon is a valuable asset in battle for Sakon, as his arms and legs can be used to strengthen Sakon's attacks as well as block attacks that Sakon cannot. When in their level 2 cursed seal form, each is given increased healing abilities and armor as well as becoming ogre-like in appearance.

Sakon and Ukon are very twisted and enjoy bad-mouthing the opposition. Orochimaru notes Sakon to be the fastest and strongest member of the Sound Four, traits Sakon is very proud of. When in battle Sakon likes to prolong the fight by toying with the opponent and all the while use unnecessarily powerful techniques. This tendency of Sakon's causes him to slow down the rest of the group whenever he gets interested in an opponent. Ukon is able to counteract this flaw by being more impatient and hasty than his brother, forcing Sakon to quickly end his battles. During the Sasuke Retrieval arc, Sakon and Ukon fight and almost defeat Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru. Before they can finish the two off, however, Kankuro arrives and kills them both with his puppets, saving Kiba and Akamaru.








 Final Notes and Tips:
 =======================

         Some tips you should remember when using Sakon & Ukon:

         1. You can turn into Curse Seal transformation in battle. See commands list for more                    details.

         2. He use kunais, ground and wall stand only.

         3. Do not forget use your chakra power to performer hyper attacks.

         4. Specials are incomplete due its not rip yet.
         
         5. Specials are based in the Anime.
         
         6. Rashomon is a super reversal and can hit the opponent too, can stop
            any projectile and hits from enemy.





 Extra Info:
 -------------------
         a-. The MAX HYPER ATTACK is a copy from the author "Xavier - kyuubi__naruto - 
             Ultimatedude" for more compatibility and common characters.

         b-. Some specials move has been coded using KOF characters like chakra ON, Sound
             effects, helpers.etc.

         c-. Some states explain how it works, see the files for more information (for novices).


         d-. Change the classic "QCF QCF_x" commands to a+b buttons in hyper attacks
             easy to fight and beat!


 BUGS:
 -------------------
 I`d had fixing bugs known, the most were in common-states (5000-5999), some other depends the-
 changeanim2 in grab states in each players.

         a-. In some cases when the opponent use the changeanim2 controller, this code values 
             must be exist (animations in AIR), see your player cns when MUGEN display invalid
             states.

         b-. BUGS when the opponent use the changeanim2 controller.
	     in order to respect the required sprites, always will use the standard groups
	     (5000-5072), These sprites are necessary for your character to appear correctly
 	     when   thrown. sorry, I could`nt fix that.
 	     
 	  NOTE: the ChangeAnim2 controller do not work with CS tranformation gethit state.
 	     
 What`s Done:
 -------------------

         a-. Many bug-fixes.

         b-. AI no optimized yet (30 % done).
         
         c-. All the basic moves are done.
         
         d-. Release Beta 1.0 (75 %).
